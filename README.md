# A Simple Bayesian Model to Estimate the Proportion of COVID-19 Cases from Test Results

This is the code that was used to generate the results for the following Medium article: [How to Estimate the True Number of COVID-19 Cases](https://medium.com/@igor.labutov_99255/how-to-estimate-the-true-number-of-covid-19-cases-63838529a4cc)

## Requirements

The following are required:

- Python3
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib

## Running

To run the simulation:

```
python sim.py
```

To plot:

```
python plot.py
```

The generated plot will be saved as a file in the same directory.


Note that the parameters for choosing which simulation to run are stored directly in the `sim.py` file.
